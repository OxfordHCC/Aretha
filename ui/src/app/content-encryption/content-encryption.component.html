	For modern devices, using encryption prevents others from reading it by encoding it before sending it across the internet (this is what the padlock in your browser indicates when visiting https websites). Despite this, it is still possible to know where that data is going - this is actually how the study software can determine where your devices are sending data, even though itâ€™s encrypted.

	<p *ngSwitchCase="3">
	Many cheap, low quality smart devices don't use these techniques though, and send data over the internet in a way that anyone can read it. The lack of security often extends to other areas, with thousands of devices often having the same default passwords making them easy pickings for hackers.
