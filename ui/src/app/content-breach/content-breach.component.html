<h3>Data Breaches</h3>

<div [ngSwitch]="stage">
	<p *ngSwitchCase="1">
	In reality, perfect security is impossible, and sometimes companies have customer information stolen in data breaches. This data can include information you gave them, like your name and address, but also information collected by your devices.
	</p>

	<p *ngSwitchCase="2">
	Hackers will often collect lists of email addresses, usernames, and passwords from data breaches and try these credentials on other sites. If you use the same password in several different places, then this makes it easy for them to take over multiple accounts as soon as one is compromised.
	</p>
	
	<p *ngSwitchCase="3">
Services like "haveibeenpwned" collate information on data breaches and let you check if any of your account details have been disclosed as part of a data breach. This is what we use to check the services accessed by your devices (see sidebar).
