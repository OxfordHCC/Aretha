<h3>Tracking and Advertising</h3>

<div [ngSwitch]="stage">

	Advertising is the main business model financing media production on the open web, and the drive to increase revenue by targeting ads to selected users has led to the creation of a plethora of companies dedicated to monitoring our clicks, searches, and reading habits as we move around the Internet.

	These small amounts of information seem worthless on their own, but companies use them to build models about you that can infer your gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual preferences, and health. In many cases, these models are also used to predict when you’re going through major life events, such as graduation or pregnancy, as these are when you’re most vulnerable to the creation of new shopping habits.

		There have been some attempts to curtail online tracking on the basis that it represents a disproportionate invasion of privacy. One example of this is the "do not track" or DNT standard for web browsers. When users activate the DNT setting in their web browsers, it sends a signal to visited websites that they should refrain from tracking them. Do not track is considered a step in the right direction by privacy advocates, but a lack of legal and regulatory enforcement means that many companies do not honor DNT signals.

It combines both technology (a way to let users signal whether they want to be tracked) as well as a policy framework for how companies should respond to that signal.</small></p>
